# Notebooks Module - User Guide

## What is This?

This module is **one of the available options for SAGE's image generation system**. It lets you manage and run Stable Diffusion jupyter notebooks on Kaggle's free cloud servers with GPU access, and connects them securely to your SAGE application through Zrok tunnels.
SAGE comes with local preconfigured fully functional jupyter notebooks already!

**SAGE's Image Generation Options:**
- **Kaggle Notebooks** (this module) - Free GPU-powered Stable Diffusion with full model control (tgis module)
- **Pollinations** - External free API for quick image generation, no setup for txt2img, needs free API key for img2img
- **Freepik** ‚Äî free external API (for Composite nanobana feature, needs API key)

You can switch between these options at any time using **Dashboard ‚Üí Scheduler ‚Üí "switch genframe to..."**

---

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

1. Add Kaggle + Zrok tokens in **üîë API Configuration**
2. In **Notebooks**: pick a model and click
**‚ñ∂Ô∏è Push to Kaggle**  (for üíª Local only notebooks) or **üîÑ Sync & Run** when your notebook exists already remote
3. Wait for the Zrok tunnel to appear in the **üåê Zrok** card
4. In **Dashboard ‚Üí Scheduler**:
   - Run **switch genframe to ...** [jupyter OR jupyter_lcm]
   - Run **zup üöá update genframes zrok tunnel url**
5. Set active style in **Floatool ‚Üí üé® Styles** (match model)
6. Generate images in SAGE
7. Make sure to ALWAYS manually stop notebooks in your kaggle account "View active events" on kaggle.com (after a complete image generation session with multiple image generations) to only use GPU hours when you are really generating images

## The Big Picture: How SAGE Generates Images

     ‚îÇ
  GPU on Kaggle
```

**With Notebooks (this module):**

1. You use SAGE's interface to describe the image you want
2. SAGE sends the request through a secure Zrok tunnel
3. A Kaggle notebook with GPU processes your request using Stable Diffusion
4. The generated image comes back through the tunnel to SAGE
5. You see your image - all without needing your own GPU!

**With External APIs:**

1. You use SAGE's interface to describe the image you want
2. SAGE sends the request directly to Pollinations or Freepik
3. Their servers process your request
4. The generated image comes back to SAGE
5. You see your image!

## Why Use Notebooks Instead of External APIs?

**Advantages of Notebooks:**
- Full control over which Stable Diffusion model to use
- Access to specialized models (anime, photorealistic, artistic styles)
- ControlNet support for precise image control
- Free GPU access (within Kaggle's weekly quota)
- Your own private instance

**Advantages of External APIs:**
- No setup required
- Instant availability (no waiting for notebook startup)
- No GPU quota management
- No tunnel configuration needed

**Use notebooks when you want specific models and control. Use external APIs when you want convenience and speed.**

## Why Use This?

- **Multiple Generation Options**: Choose between notebooks (full control) or external APIs (convenience)
- **Free GPU Access**: Generate images without expensive hardware (when using notebooks)
- **Cloud Computing**: All processing happens on remote servers, not your device
- **Multiple Models**: Access different Stable Diffusion models for different styles
- **Easy Management**: Pull, edit, and push notebooks with just a few clicks
- **Flexible Setup**: Switch between notebooks and external APIs anytime
- **Secure Tunneling**: Private connections to your notebooks (when using Zrok)

## Managing GPU Usage

### Important: Stop Notebooks When Not in Use

**Kaggle provides limited free GPU hours per week**. To conserve your quota:

1. **Go to your Kaggle account** at [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)
2. **Select "View active events"**
3. **Stop any running notebooks** when you're done generating images

**Best Practice**: Always manually stop notebooks in Kaggle when not actively generating images. Don't rely on auto-timeout.

### Checking Your GPU Usage

- Log in to Kaggle
- Go to your profile
- Check your weekly GPU quota usage
- Plan accordingly to avoid running out mid-project

## Connecting SAGE to Your Notebook

### Understanding the Connection Requirements

SAGE's Scheduler is the bridge between your notebooks and image generation. Two settings must be configured:

1. **Genframe Service**: Which image generation method to use
2. **Zrok Tunnel URL**: The connection address to your active notebook

**These do NOT update automatically** - you must manually configure them via Dashboard ‚Üí Scheduler.

### Setting the Genframe Service

**What is "genframe"?**  
Genframe is SAGE's term for the image generation backend. SAGE supports multiple backends that you can switch between:

- **notebooks [jupyter OR jupyter_lcm]**: Your Kaggle notebooks via Zrok tunnel (full model control, free GPU)
- **pollinations**: External free API (instant, no setup, limited models)
- **freepik**: External paid API (advanced features, requires API key)

**When to set it:**
- First time using any generation service
- When switching between notebooks and external APIs
- When switching between different external APIs
- If image generation suddenly stops working

**How to set it:**
1. Go to **Dashboard ‚Üí Scheduler**
2. Find the appropriate entry:
   - **"sw üå† Switch to genframe API: pollinations, freepik, jupyter, jupyter_lcm"** and fill red box (case-sensitive - no spaces allowed)
   - Red box for Kaggle notebooks: `jupyter` OR `jupyter_lcm`
   - Red box for Pollinations API: `pollinations`
   - Red box for Freepik API: `freepik`
3. Click **‚ñ∂ [play button]** afterwards
4. Confirmation can be viewed in Dashboard > Log > select latest log out file

**Important**: You can only use one genframe service at a time. Switching is instant and takes effect immediately. Usually you do NOT want to run this during an image generation with multiple images

### Updating the Zrok Tunnel URL

**Why is this needed?**  
Each time a notebook starts, it creates a new Zrok tunnel with a unique URL. SAGE needs to know this URL to send image generation requests. This can only be done after the jupyter notebook successfully created the tunnel URL.

**When to update:**
- ‚úÖ After starting a notebook for the first time
- ‚úÖ After restarting an existing notebook
- ‚úÖ After switching to a different model/notebook
- ‚úÖ If SAGE reports connection errors

**How to update:**
1. **Confirm tunnel is active**:
   - Scroll to üåê Zrok section in Notebooks module
   - Verify you see an active tunnel listed
   - Click üîÑ Reload to refresh if needed

2. **Navigate to Scheduler**:
   - Go to **Dashboard** in SAGE's main navigation
   - Click **Scheduler**

3. **Find the tunnel update entry**:
   - Look for: **"zup üöá update genframes zrok tunnel url"**

4. **Run the update**:
   - Click the **‚ñ∂ [play button]**
   - Wait a few seconds for confirmation

5. **Done!**: SAGE can now communicate with your notebook

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you run the **zup** scheduler entry:
1. The script `bash/zrok_update.sh` executes
2. It queries the Zrok API for active tunnels
3. It retrieves the current tunnel URL
4. It updates SAGE's configuration file
5. Image generation requests now route to your notebook
