### What are Styles?

Styles in SAGE are **organizational tags and prompt modifiers** that help you manage and enhance your image generation. They serve three main purposes:

1. **Tagging**: Label generated images with style names
2. **Filtering**: Organize and find images in your gallery
3. **Prompt Enhancement**: Automatically add style-specific text to prompts

### Important: Styles ≠ Models

**Key Distinction:**
- **Styles**: Metadata, tags, and prompt additions in SAGE (managed in Floatool)
- **Models**: The actual AI running on Kaggle or external services (Counterfeit-V3, SDXL, Pollinations, etc.)

**Example:**
- You might run the **Counterfeit-V3 model** on Kaggle (the AI doing the work)
- While using the **"anime" style** in SAGE (tagging and prompt enhancement)

Styles help organize and enhance, but the actual image generation quality comes from the model you're using.
