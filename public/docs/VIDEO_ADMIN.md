# Video Management Admin: User Guide
Welcome to your Video Management hub! This guide will walk you through everything you can do in this powerful tool, from uploading your first video to organizing complex playlists.
### First Look: The Main Screen
When you first open the admin panel, you'll see a clean and simple layout:
*   **Header:** At the top, you'll find the title "Video Management" and a primary blue button labeled **Upload Video**.
*   **Navigation Tabs:** Below the header are three main sections to help you stay organized: **Videos**, **Playlists**, and **Categories**.
Let's explore each section in detail.
---
### Managing Videos (The "Videos" Tab)
This is the main area where you'll see and interact with all your individual video files.
#### Finding and Filtering Your Videos
Just above the video list, you'll find a powerful filter bar to help you find exactly what you're looking for:
*   **Search videos...:** Simply start typing a name or word from a description to instantly filter the list.
*   **All Categories:** Use this dropdown to only show videos that belong to a specific category.
*   **All Videos / [Playlist Name]:** Use this dropdown to either see all videos or only the videos that are part of a specific playlist.
#### Uploading a New Video
1.  Click the blue **Upload Video** button at the top of the page.
2.  A pop-up window will appear with a large area that says "Click to select or drag & drop video." You can either click it to open your computer's file browser or simply drag a video file directly onto it.
3.  Once you've selected a file, its name and size will appear, and you can fill in the details:
    *   ***Video Name:*** This is automatically filled from the filename but you can change it to be more descriptive.
    *   ***Description:*** Add any notes or a summary about the video here.
    *   ***Category:*** Assign the video to one of your categories using this dropdown.
4.  Click the green **Upload** button. A progress bar will show the upload status. Once finished, the pop-up will close, and your new video will appear in the list!
#### Video Actions
In the main video list, each video has a row of buttons in the "Actions" column:
*   **Edit:** Click this to open a pop-up where you can change the video's name, description, or category. You can also make a video inactive by unchecking the "Active" box.
*   **Playlists:** This opens a pop-up with a checklist of all your playlists. Simply check the boxes for the playlists you want this video to be a part of and click **Add to Playlists**.
*   **Thumbnail:** If a video's thumbnail looks wrong or you want to refresh it, click this button. The system will automatically try to create a new one from the video file.
*   **View:** This will open the video file directly so you can watch it.
*   **Delete:** Clicking this will ask for confirmation. If you agree, it will permanently delete the video and its thumbnail from the server and remove it from all playlists. **This cannot be undone.**

### Managing Playlists (The "Playlists" Tab)
Playlists are curated collections of your videos. This is where you organize them.
#### Creating a New Playlist
1.  Click the blue **Create Playlist** button.
2.  In the pop-up window, give your new playlist a **Name** and an optional **Description**.
3.  Click **Save Changes**, and your new playlist will appear in the list.
#### Reordering Your Playlists
This is the main feature of this tab. To change the order in which your playlists appear:
1.  **Click and hold** on any playlist in the list.
2.  **Drag it up or down** to its new position.
3.  **Let go.** The new order is saved automatically! You'll see a small "Saving order..." indicator appear briefly.
#### Playlist Actions
Each playlist card has its own set of buttons:
*   **View:** Takes you to a public-facing page where you can watch the videos in this playlist.
*   **Edit:** Opens the same pop-up as creating a playlist, allowing you to change its name or description.
*   **Sort:** Takes you to a special full-screen page where you can drag and drop the *videos within that specific playlist* to change their playback order.
*   **JSON:** This is a feature for advanced use. It opens a pop-up with a block of specially formatted text. You can click **Copy to Clipboard** and paste this text into other systems (like your post manager) to embed the playlist.
*   **X (Delete):** The red 'X' button in the corner will delete the playlist. This does *not* delete the videos themselves; it only removes the collection.

### Managing Categories (The "Categories" Tab)
Think of categories like folders for your videos. They help you keep everything organized on the backend.
#### Creating a New Category
1.  Click the blue **Create Category** button.
2.  In the pop-up, give the category a **Name**, an optional **Description**, and a **Sort Order** number (lower numbers appear first).
3.  Click **Save Changes**.
#### Category Actions
Each category is shown as a card with two buttons:
*   **Edit:** Allows you to change the category's name, description, or sort order.
*   **Delete:** You can only delete a category if there are no videos assigned to it. If you try to delete a category that still contains videos, the system will give you a warning. You must first go to the "Videos" tab and reassign those videos to a different category (or no category) before you can delete the old one.
